Version 1.0 - 2019-04-08

I've been working on a CLI Google Search script for a while now, and
I think this is at the point where I am finally ready to make this
repo public.

Whats different?

Well, the big thing is that the scripts are a lot less messier. I used
to have one script call on a couple other files, one to draw the logo,
another for the input box... it was embarassing.

But that is how my brain works... totally organized chaos.

So I consolidated everything down to just a few files.

I also didn't want to leave all the other search engines out, so I ren-
amed the repo from 'CLIGoogleSearch' to 'CLISearch', and sometime in
the near future, will be adding Bing, Duck, etc to the mix.

Until then, enjoy Googling from your terminal with what I have so far.

Cheers!
